# ConsoleForge

A native macOS app for managing multiple AI coding terminal sessions in tabs.

## Tech Stack
- Swift 5.9+ / SwiftUI (macOS 14+)
- SwiftTerm (SPM) for terminal emulation with PTY support
- posix_spawn + openpty for fork-safe process launching (hardened runtime compatible)

## Architecture
- **Models/**: Data types (SessionConfiguration, SessionFolder, SessionState)
- **Services/**: SessionStore (persistence + state), ClaudeProcessBuilder (CLI arg builder), PtyProcess (PTY management)
- **Views/**: SwiftUI views organized by feature (Sidebar, Terminal, SessionEditor, Settings)

## Build & Run
```bash
swift build
swift run
```

## Key Design Decisions
- Terminal views are kept alive in a ZStack (hidden with opacity) to preserve running processes when switching tabs
- Sessions persist to `~/Library/Application Support/ConsoleForge/sessions.json`
- PtyProcess uses posix_spawn (not forkpty) for hardened runtime compatibility
- Claude binary is resolved via common path search at startup, configurable in Settings (Cmd+,)
- Login shell (`zsh -l -c`) used to inherit user's PATH for running CLI tools

## Session Configuration Fields
- name, workingDirectory, model, permissionMode, effort
- systemPrompt, appendSystemPrompt, initialPrompt
- allowedTools, disallowedTools, mcpConfigPath
- additionalFlags (raw CLI flags, one per line)
- tabColorHex, tabIconName (SF Symbol), autoStart, continueSession, openInConsoleForge
